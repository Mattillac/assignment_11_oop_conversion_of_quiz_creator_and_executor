AS I APPLIED THE PREVIOUS LESSON ABOUT OOP, I STRUGGLED A BIT AND WATCHED A BRO CODE VIDEO, AND IT HELPED ME AS WELL. I STRUGGLED AT MY DEBUGGING AND THE CREATING AS WELL BUT THE MOST TORTURING ONE IS THE DEBUGGING BECAUSE I WAS ALL FEELING SATISFIED WUTH MY WORK, KNOWING THAT I AM DONE! BUT I NEED TO FIND THE ERROR AND IT WAS THE PARENTHESIS AT MY QUIZ CREATOR. so overall, i thank all of my previous practices and know i created my first OOP program, thanks to sir! i managed to use all of his lessons to my one's knowledge by applying and adapting it!
